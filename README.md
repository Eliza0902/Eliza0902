Welcome!

You have reached my profile page and I hope you choose to stay and take a look around!

Before I started my coding journey with Bloomtech, I spent most of my time either in kitchen or doing escape rooms. I love puzzles and that is what drew me
to learning how to code. I have learned so much and look forward to learning more. 

You can reach me through my linkedin (Elizabeth Herrera) or through my email a.herr.elizabeth@gmail.com
